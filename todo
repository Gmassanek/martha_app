Text for page:  Thank you very much for your interest in the conference.  Please use the space below (stage one is just to have a link to the email, stage two is to have a form for a user to fill out that automatically sends the email.  I think I should be able to get both stages done but I'll do stage one, then the rest of the items, then stage two) to indicate your question and we will get back to you soon.

Should link email that is sent to phood2@jhmi.edu<mailto:phood2@jhmi.edu>, with âAcute Care Summitâ in subject line if possible   should  we have to empty out our "test registrants"?

Phone number for contact â Peggy Hood 410-955-1942, email phood2@jhmi.edu<mailto:phood2@jhmi.edu>  Tomorrow (monday)
Registration info â checks should be made payable to Acute Care Leadership Summit  Tomorrow (monday)
